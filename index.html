<p> 
The web is made up of various pages of htlm. HTML, which stands for <em> HyperText Markup Language</em> is what "glues" the web together and makes up the main type of document on the web.   
</p>
    <p> 
  The internet communication begins with a browser, which communicates to the web using <b> hyperlinks</b>. Those hyperlinks via HTTP, communicate to web servers that provide the information back to the browser and ultimately, to the user. HTTP is the protocol for how the internet communicates with the servers. </p>

As previously mentioned, HTML documents are the heart of the web. It is made up of <em> text content </em> (what you see), <em> markup </em> (what it looks like), <em> references</em> to other documents (images and video), and <em> links </em> to other pages.

<p> <b> Markup </b> are facets of HTML which are made up of tags (tag name) and tag contents. This is called an element. Another way to think of this is Opening Tag (tag)  + Content + Closing Tag (/tag) = Element. </p>
  <p>
    <b> Tags</b> </p>
Some tags that we have recently learned about include: </p>
1. B-Tag, which bolds text. (b) <b> Text </b> (/b) <div>
2. Em-Tag, which stands for emphasis,  italizes text. (em) <em> Text </em> (/em) 

  <p>Keep in mind that computers are "stupid", meaning they may accept something as is, where a smart human may see it as an error. For example, if a closing tag is not included in the end of the desired element, the computer will continue to apply the tag to the remainder of the text. For example: "The book titled, <em> (em) Charlotte's Web is about a pig and his spider friend. </em> The computer will not catch that we intended to write: "The book titled <em> (em) Charlotte's Web </em> (/em)is about a pig and his spider friend." </p>
<b> HTML Attributes </b>
  <p> HTML attributes start as tags and closing tags do, but they also include attributes, which equals a value. HTML attributes look something like (tag attr= “value”) content (/tag). An example of an attribute is an anchor tag, which is for creating links. An anchor tag would look something like (a href = "http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steve_Prefontaine") <a href="http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steve_Prefontaine" > Prefontaine </a> (/a) would be an href attribute linking the word Prefontain to Steve Prefontaine's Wikipedia page.</p>
<p> Another HTML attribute tag is the IMG tag. Its attribute is Source, which looks like = src, and the src attribute is a link to an image. Associated to the src attribute, is the alt attribute, which offers text in the event that the image doesn't load or for those users who are visually impaired. While not required it is very helpful to include to your tag for those reasons. Unlike other tags, the IMG tag does not have content. As such, it does not require a closing tag. This is called a void tag. This is what an IMG void tag with an alt tag may look like: (img src = "http://images.clipartpanda.com/op-clipart-runningshoes2.gif" alt = "runningshoes") to show running shoes. Your IMG tag would materialize into something like this: <p> <img src="http://images.clipartpanda.com/op-clipart-runningshoes2.gif" alt="runningshoes"> </p>
<p> <b> Line Breaks</b> </p>
<p> In order to break text into multiple lines, you must use one of two tags, the BR tag or the P tag. The BR tag is an inline tag which breaks text into two lines. It is also a void tag, meaning you only require one tag. The BR tag would look like this: (br). <br> The P tag, which stands for paragraph is a block element and requires a closing tag. The P tag looks like this (p) Text (/p) <p> A p tag is a block text because an invisible square surrounds the content within that element. The square has height and width, unlike the inline, br tag which just wraps text to a new line. </p>
<p><b> Container elements</b></p>
Container elements consist of SPAN and DIV. SPAN is an inline element while DIV is a block element. They contain their content and can allow us to manipulate how certain content looks. These elements will allow us to format the look of the text. 
<p> <b> HTML Document Structure</b><p>
An HTML Document is structured to include several tags and elements. The structure starts with a DOCTYPE, which is the html string. There are also opening (html) and closing (/html) tags that encapsule the document. The following tag is a head tag (head) (/head) which surrounds the metadata and other information. In between the head tags we have the title tags. The title tags may also reference any CSS or Java script files for the html document. The body tags encapsule the detail of the document. Through the IPND, the focus will be on the body of the html document.
